<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
Fuji is a social network app that allows users to connect with each other, upload posts and media using the rich text editor and a personal cloud library, users can like and comment each others posts and talk privatley on the embedded live-chat feature.

* The server is written in MVC architecture, only that the views are handled by the client app.
* The API complies to the REST standard.
* Errors in the server passed to and handled by an error controller to prevent data leaks. 

My goal building this app was to tackle challenges that arise when building large scale, feature abundant applications.
In order to make all these features work simultaneously together and communicate with each other, I came upon a new set of challenges, and solving them taught me a lot about how big apps work.
